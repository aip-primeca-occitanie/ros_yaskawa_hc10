# ROS for Yaskawa HC10

This is a WIP.

Currently:

- motoman, motoman_drive, motoman_hc_10_support, motoman_msgs, motoman_resources are taken directly from the motoman official repo, branch noetic-devel : https://github.com/ros-industrial/motoman
- motoman_hc_10_moveit_config (originally created with moveit setup assistant, and since modified) : contains all the custom files
